We never stop before that.</p><p class='font-italic'>A resource is a source of some good or service. They are assumed to be operational and also interchangeable. Like light bulbs.This is a major mistake when talking about people. Without saying that anyone is indispensable, people are indeed not so easily interchangeable and their performance can have drastic fluctuations; very especially when we talk about knowledge workers. It might be a desirable goal, it might also be convenient to see people as resources for old‐fashion planning, but it is not the way it works.</p>"
