We never stop before that.</p><p class='font-italic'>For years, when developers used to think that their job was writing code, it was common to hear things like “I am done” after the code was compiling.<br> Or things like “it works on my machine”. Users were frustrated. Then Scrum introduced the concept of Definition of Done. When you use Teamshore, there is only one definition of done: a delighted customer.</p>"
